## 🍹 **Try it out!**

## 🤔 **Why?**

I encountered a problem that my BeReal notification arrived late, arrived without sound, or did not arrive at all. After searching the Internet, I found out that I am not the only one who has this problem. Therefore, I decided to transfer BeReal notifications to Telegram, which has an instant speed of sending notifications, without loss, and has the ability to customize the notification sound. 

As a result, notifications now arrive smoothly and much earlier than the official notification.

## ❓ **How it works?**

- To obtain notification data, we use the internal API of the BeReal application, for example: [Click](https://mobile.bereal.com/api/bereal/moments/last/europe-west)
- To update the data, we use short polling with the interval specified in the `settings.json` file. Not the best variant, but this API does not support long polling or webhook methods.

## ☑️ **Installation**

### 🌄 **Requirements**
